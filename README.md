# Extism Go PDK

This library can be used to write
[Extism Plug-ins](https://extism.org/docs/concepts/plug-in) in Go.

## Install

Include the library with Go get:

```bash
go get github.com/extism/go-pdk
```

## Reference Documentation

You can find the reference documentation for this library on
[pkg.go.dev](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/extism/go-pdk).

## Getting Started

The goal of writing an
[Extism plug-in](https://extism.org/docs/concepts/plug-in) is to compile your Go
code to a Wasm module with exported functions that the host application can
invoke. The first thing you should understand is creating an export. Let's write
a simple program that exports a `greet` function which will take a name as a
string and return a greeting string. Paste this into your `main.go`:

```go
package main

import (
	"github.com/extism/go-pdk"
)

//export greet
func greet() int32 {
	input := pdk.Input()
	greeting := `Hello, ` + string(input) + `!`
	pdk.OutputString(greeting)
	return 0
}

func main() {}
```

Some things to note about this code:

1. The `//export greet` comment is required. This marks the greet function as an
   export with the name `greet` that can be called by the host.
2. We need a `main` but it is unused.
3. Exports in the Go PDK are coded to the raw ABI. You get parameters from the
   host by calling
   [pdk.Input* functions](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/extism/go-pdk#Input) and
   you send returns back with the
   [pdk.Output* functions](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/extism/go-pdk#Output).
4. An Extism export expects an i32 return code. `0` is success and `1` is a
   failure.

Install the `tinygo` compiler:

See https://tinygo.org/getting-started/install/ for instructions for your
platform.

> Note: while the core Go toolchain has support to target WebAssembly, we find
> `tinygo` to work well for plug-in code. Please open issues on this repository
> if you try building with `go build` instead & have problems!

Compile this with the command:

```bash
tinygo build -o plugin.wasm -target wasip1 main.go
```

We can now test `plugin.wasm` using the
[Extism CLI](https://github.com/extism/cli)'s `run` command:

```bash
extism call plugin.wasm greet --input "Benjamin" --wasi
# => Hello, Benjamin!
```

> **Note**: Currently `wasip1` must be provided for all Go plug-ins even if they
> don't need system access, however this will eventually be optional.

> **Note**: We also have a web-based, plug-in tester called the
> [Extism Playground](https://playground.extism.org/)

### More Exports: Error Handling

Suppose we want to re-write our greeting module to never greet Benjamins. We can
use [pdk.SetError](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/extism/go-pdk#SetError) or
[pdk.SetErrorString](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/extism/go-pdk#SetErrorString):

```go
//export greet
func greet() int32 {
	name := string(pdk.Input())
	if name == "Benjamin" {
		pdk.SetError(errors.New("Sorry, we don't greet Benjamins!"))
		return 1
	}
	greeting := `Hello, ` + name + `!`
	pdk.OutputString(greeting)
	return 0
}
```

Now when we try again:

```bash
extism call plugin.wasm greet --input="Benjamin" --wasi
# => Error: Sorry, we don't greet Benjamins!
echo $? # print last status code
# => 1
extism call plugin.wasm greet --input="Zach" --wasi
# => Hello, Zach!
echo $?
# => 0
```

### Json

Extism export functions simply take bytes in and bytes out. Those can be
whatever you want them to be. A common and simple way to get more complex types
to and from the host is with json:

```go
type Add struct {
	A int `json:"a"`
	B int `json:"b"`
}

type Sum struct {
	Sum int `json:"sum"`
}

//export add
func add() int32 {
	params := Add{}
	// use json input helper, which automatically unmarshals the plugin input into your struct
	err := pdk.InputJSON(&params)
	if err != nil {
		pdk.SetError(err)
		return 1
	}
	sum := Sum{Sum: params.A + params.B}
	// use json output helper, which automatically marshals your struct to the plugin output
	output, err := pdk.OutputJSON(sum)
	if err != nil {
		pdk.SetError(err)
		return 1
	}
	return 0
}
```

```bash
extism call plugin.wasm add --input='{"a": 20, "b": 21}' --wasi
# => {"sum":41}
```

## Configs

Configs are key-value pairs that can be passed in by the host when creating a
plug-in. These can be useful to statically configure the plug-in with some data
that exists across every function call. Here is a trivial example using
[pdk.GetConfig](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/extism/go-pdk#GetConfig):

```go
//export greet
func greet() int32 {
	user, ok := pdk.GetConfig("user")
	if !ok {
		pdk.SetErrorString("This plug-in requires a 'user' key in the config")
		return 1
	}
	greeting := `Hello, ` + user + `!`
	pdk.OutputString(greeting)
	return 0
}
```

To test it, the [Extism CLI](https://github.com/extism/cli) has a `--config`
option that lets you pass in `key=value` pairs:

```bash
extism call plugin.wasm greet --config user=Benjamin
# => Hello, Benjamin!
```

## Variables

Variables are another key-value mechanism but it's a mutable data store that
will persist across function calls. These variables will persist as long as the
host has loaded and not freed the plug-in.

```go
//export count
func count() int32 {
	count := pdk.GetVarInt("count")
	count = count + 1
	pdk.SetVarInt("count", count)
	pdk.OutputString(strconv.Itoa(count))
	return 0
}
```

> **Note**: Use the untyped variants
> [pdk.SetVar(string, []byte)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/extism/go-pdk#SetVar)
> and
> [pdk.GetVar(string) []byte](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/extism/go-pdk#GetVar)
> to handle your own types.

## Logging

Because Wasm modules by default do not have access to the system, printing to
stdout won't work (unless you use WASI). Extism provides a simple
[logging function](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/extism/go-pdk#Log) that allows
you to use the host application to log without having to give the plug-in
permission to make syscalls.

```go
//export log_stuff
func logStuff() int32 {
	pdk.Log(pdk.LogInfo, "An info log!")
	pdk.Log(pdk.LogDebug, "A debug log!")
	pdk.Log(pdk.LogWarn, "A warn log!")
	pdk.Log(pdk.LogError, "An error log!")
	return 0
}
```

From [Extism CLI](https://github.com/extism/cli):

```bash
extism call plugin.wasm log_stuff --wasi --log-level=debug
2023/10/12 12:11:23 Calling function : log_stuff
2023/10/12 12:11:23 An info log!
2023/10/12 12:11:23 A debug log!
2023/10/12 12:11:23 A warn log!
2023/10/12 12:11:23 An error log!
```

> _Note_: From the CLI you need to pass a level with `--log-level`. If you are
> running the plug-in in your own host using one of our SDKs, you need to make
> sure that you call `set_log_file` to `"stdout"` or some file location.

## HTTP

Sometimes it is useful to let a plug-in
[make HTTP calls](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/extism/go-pdk#HTTPRequest.Send).
[See this example](example/http/tiny_main.go)

```go
//export http_get
func httpGet() int32 {
	// create an HTTP Request (withuot relying on WASI), set headers as needed
	req := pdk.NewHTTPRequest(pdk.MethodGet, "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1")
	req.SetHeader("some-name", "some-value")
	req.SetHeader("another", "again")
	// send the request, get response back (can check status on response via res.Status())
	res := req.Send()

	pdk.OutputMemory(res.Memory())

	return 0
}
```

By default, Extism modules cannot make HTTP requests unless you specify which
hosts it can connect to. You can use `--alow-host` in the Extism CLI to set
this:

```
extism call plugin.wasm http_get --wasi --allow-host='*.typicode.com'
# => { "userId": 1, "id": 1, "title": "delectus aut autem", "completed": false }
```

## Imports (Host Functions)

Like any other code module, Wasm not only let's you export functions to the
outside world, you can import them too. Host Functions allow a plug-in to import
functions defined in the host. For example, if you host application is written
in Python, it can pass a Python function down to your Go plug-in where you can
invoke it.

This topic can get fairly complicated and we have not yet fully abstracted the
Wasm knowledge you need to do this correctly. So we recommend reading our
[concept doc on Host Functions](https://extism.org/docs/concepts/host-functions)
before you get started.

### A Simple Example

Host functions have a similar interface as exports. You just need to declare
them as extern on the top of your main.go. You only declare the interface as it
is the host's responsibility to provide the implementation:

```go
//go:wasmimport extism:host/user a_python_func
func aPythonFunc(uint64) uint64
```

We should be able to call this function as a normal Go function. Note that we
need to manually handle the pointer casting:

```go
//export hello_from_python
func helloFromPython() int32 {
    msg := "An argument to send to Python"
    mem := pdk.AllocateString(msg)
    defer mem.Free()
    ptr := aPythonFunc(mem.Offset())
    rmem := pdk.FindMemory(ptr)
    response := string(rmem.ReadBytes())
    pdk.OutputString(response)
    return 0
}
```

### Testing it out

We can't really test this from the Extism CLI as something must provide the
implementation. So let's write out the Python side here. Check out the
[docs for Host SDKs](https://extism.org/docs/concepts/host-sdk) to implement a
host function in a language of your choice.

```python
from extism import host_fn, Plugin

@host_fn()
def a_python_func(input: str) -> str:
    # just printing this out to prove we're in Python land
    print("Hello from Python!")

    # let's just add "!" to the input string
    # but you could imagine here we could add some
    # applicaiton code like query or manipulate the database
    # or our application APIs
    return input + "!"
```

Now when we load the plug-in we pass the host function:

```python
manifest = {"wasm": [{"path": "/path/to/plugin.wasm"}]}
plugin = Plugin(manifest, functions=[a_python_func], wasi=True)
result = plugin.call('hello_from_python', b'').decode('utf-8')
print(result)
```

```bash
python3 app.py
# => Hello from Python!
# => An argument to send to Python!
```

## Reactor modules

Since TinyGo version 0.34.0, the compiler has native support for 
[Reactor modules](https://dylibso.com/blog/wasi-command-reactor/).

Make sure you invoke the compiler with the `-buildmode=c-shared` flag
so that libc and the Go runtime are properly initialized:

```bash
cd example/reactor
tinygo build -target wasip1 -buildmode=c-shared -o reactor.wasm ./tiny_main.go
extism call ./reactor.wasm read_file --input "./test.txt" --allow-path . --wasi --log-level info
# => Hello World!
```

### Note on TinyGo 0.33.0 and earlier

TinyGo versions below 0.34.0 do not support
[Reactor modules](https://dylibso.com/blog/wasi-command-reactor/).
If you want to use WASI inside your Reactor module functions (exported functions other
than `main`). You can however import the `wasi-reactor` module to ensure that libc
and go runtime are initialized as expected:

```go
package main

import (
	"os"

	"github.com/extism/go-pdk"
	_ "github.com/extism/go-pdk/wasi-reactor"
)

//export read_file
func read_file() {
	name := pdk.InputString()

	content, err := os.ReadFile(name)
	if err != nil {
		pdk.Log(pdk.LogError, err.Error())
		return
	}

	pdk.Output(content)
}

func main() {}
```

```bash
tinygo build -target wasip1 -o reactor.wasm ./tiny_main.go
extism call ./reactor.wasm read_file --input "./test.txt" --allow-path . --wasi --log-level info
# => Hello World!
```

Note: this is not required if you only have the `main` function.

## Generating Bindings

It's often very useful to define a schema to describe the function signatures
and types you want to use between Extism SDK and PDK languages.

[XTP Bindgen](https://github.com/dylibso/xtp-bindgen) is an open source
framework to generate PDK bindings for Extism plug-ins. It's used by the
[XTP Platform](https://www.getxtp.com/), but can be used outside of the platform
to define any Extism compatible plug-in system.

### 1. Install the `xtp` CLI.

See installation instructions
[here](https://docs.xtp.dylibso.com/docs/cli#installation).

### 2. Create a schema using our OpenAPI-inspired IDL:

```yaml
version: v1-draft
exports: 
  CountVowels:
      input: 
          type: string
          contentType: text/plain; charset=utf-8
      output:
          $ref: "#/components/schemas/VowelReport"
          contentType: application/json
# components.schemas defined in example-schema.yaml...
```

> See an example in [example-schema.yaml](./example-schema.yaml), or a full
> "kitchen sink" example on
> [the docs page](https://docs.xtp.dylibso.com/docs/concepts/xtp-schema/).

### 3. Generate bindings to use from your plugins:

```
xtp plugin init --schema-file ./example-schema.yaml
    1. TypeScript                      
  > 2. Go                              
    3. Rust                            
    4. Python                          
    5. C#                              
    6. Zig                             
    7. C++                             
    8. GitHub Template                 
    9. Local Template
```

This will create an entire boilerplate plugin project for you to get started
with:

```go
package main

// returns VowelReport (The result of counting vowels on the Vowels input.)
func CountVowels(input string) (VowelReport, error) {
	// TODO: fill out your implementation here
	panic("Function not implemented.")
}
```

Implement the empty function(s), and run `xtp plugin build` to compile your
plugin.
